# Book-Builder
  Creates individual HTML pages of text using a raw text file from the Gutenberg Project. Also creates an index page based on preset variables in a separate class. This was the class project for a 300 level C++ class and, as such, is pretty beginner work. If you happen to come across this and would like to comment or make suggestions of next steps to take to possibly add functionality or re-factor, any constructive criticism is welcome.

## Getting Started

  All of the source and header files needed to compile the program are in the main folder. The zip file contains everything needed to run in a Unix environment using make.

### Prerequisites

  This was created using Code Blocks and the most recent G++ compiler using standard libraries only.

### Installing

  Should not require any installations
```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

 Each test is a raw text file that can be passed as standard input on the command line.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why: This section will be completed at a future time

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style testsd

There are no coding style tests for this assignment

```
Give an example
